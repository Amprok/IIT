          <p>My name is Adam Puckeridge. I was born in Australia & grew up in the Sutherland Shire in NSW where I attended school until year 11. In 2017 my wife and I moved to the NSW Central West with our 2 dogs & soon after took on a stray as a third. Around the same time I started to learn Japanese as a second language with English as my first & would love to visit Japan. When Iâ€™m not working I enjoy playing guitar and drums or reading anything by Stephen King.</p>

          <p>Technology as we view it today substantially increased as I was growing up. It was something new, something my parents and the generation before me were not familiar with, so it became something I could discover myself. My first encounter with technology was when I received a Sega Master System as a Christmas present. I was enthralled with what could be accomplished. Then when we were lucky enough to get a family computer that was running Windows 95, and a dial up internet connection it seemed like there were no limits. I was able to boot up games in DOS and at the time it felt like I was writing code. My understanding of technology has also been an asset when working with bands & recording music. My interest has continued to grow to this day.</p>
