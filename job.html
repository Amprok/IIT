          <p>The position I have chosen as my ideal job is as a full stack developer for Rode Microphones. The position involves building and maintaining websites through the use of Vue.js framework, JavaScript and Laravel. I have always had an interest in building websites and have enjoyed developing websites for bands i have been a part of, a music school that i worked for and a family friends vending machine business.</p>

      <h4>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h4>
        <p> Qualifications are not required for this position, however experience using Laravel framework and Vue.js is essential. I would also need experience handling large datasets and databases. Being able to work as part of a team whilst also able to act independently is also essential for this position.</p>

      <h4>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h4>
        <p>  I currently only have experience with basic HTML and CSS which I have gained from building websites using dreamweaver.</p>

      <h4>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now.</h4>
        <p>  Enrolling in a Bachelor of Information Technology will give me a foundation in all aspects of working in the Information Technology field, and then choosing to specialise in web development which will include learning how to program in Javascript, along with continuing to build websites to constantly test and push the skills i have now and will learn.</p>
