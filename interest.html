              <h4>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h4>
  <p>Technology as we view it today substantially increased as I was growing up. It was something new, something my parents and the generation before me were not familiar with, so it became something I could discover myself.<br>
<br>
     My first encounter with technology was when I received a Sega Master System as a Christmas present. Then when we were lucky enough to get a family computer that was running windows 95, and a dial up internet connection, it seemed like there were no limits. I was able to boot up games in DOS and at the time it felt like I was hacking into the computer. <br>
     <br>
     My understanding of technology has also been an asset when working with bands & recording music. My interest has continued to grow to this day.

            <h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
      <p>I chose RMIT as it offers a Bachelor of Information Technology course as a completely online learning environment. Due to living and working full time in regional NSW this was the only way I am able to study at this point in my life. RMIT has been a leader in the online learning space, so my choice to enrol with RMIT was an easy one.
  </p>

  <h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
  <p>During this course I expect to learn multiple different skills that will relate to working in the Information Technology field. A few examples are learning how to write code like HTML and CSS, networking, Artificial Intelligence and how to work effectively in a team environment.
