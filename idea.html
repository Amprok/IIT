            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>My project idea is to build a guitar & accessory collection app. The app will allow you to keep a record of each & every guitar, pedal and amp you own in one easily accessible location.
              You will be able to record data for each item i.e. brand, model, serial number, amount paid and more. The app will be able to sync across multiple devices by storing its information on a server.
              I would like to also make a web version so it can be used on any platform.</p>

            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>As a musician myself there have been many circumstances when it would have been helpful to have a guitar specific app that has the above record keeping abilities. There is currently no android application that fulfils this criteria for guitars, despite the fact that smartphones running the android operating system hold an 87 percent share of the global market as of 2019. Other collection applications are not a viable substitute due to the large range & variations of not only the instrument itself but also all of the accessories that are available.</p>



          <h4>  Description</h4>

            <p>Features I would like to include in the app are listed below.
            <li>keep an inventory of each guitar & accessory item that you own.</li>
            <li> the ability to access your inventory from any device android or iOS either through the app or via the website.</li>
            <li> photograph or use an existing photo to attach personalised pictures of your guitar, amplifier, pedal and additional accessories.</li>
            <li> record detailed information about each guitar including: Brand, Model, Year, Serial Number, Colour, Pickups, Bridge, Neck Type, Strings,  Tuning, Amount Paid</li>
            <li> enable the user to record detailed information about each amplifier including: Brand, Model, Year, Serial Number, Combo, Cabinet, Head, Speaker Type, Speaker Size, Watt, Dual or Single or Triple Channel.</li>
            <li> record detailed information about each pedal  including: Make, Model, Year, Serial Number, Type, Battery or 12V.</li>
            <li> record additional notes against each item</li>
            <li> create a PDF copy of your collection</li>
            <li> sort your guitar, amplifier,  pedal & accessories inventory by name, type, or brand</li>
            <li> the ability to favourite specific items</li>
            <li> the ability to group/pair specific guitar, pedal, pickup, tuning ect combinations</li>
            <br>
            <p>I would like to include a current value on each item based off recent sales (most likely from a website called reverb.com)
            <br>
            My Guitar Collection app will need some form of user management to store users personal data. Having a user account will help provide a personalised experience and control access to user data.
            <br>
            <br>
            My app will need a database, either in the cloud or on a server, to store all of the usersâ€™ items. This will allow access to your collection from any device and prevents you from losing all the data that has been entered. The app will also need offline functionality so it is usable when you don't have an internet connection. </p>

          <h4>  Tools and Technologies</h4>
          <p>  I'm not sure how I am going to build the app. With the research I have done so far there are a couple of options that stand out. The first is using android studio which uses either Kotlin or Java as the coding language. The second is AWS and their app building system called Amplify. The advantages to using AWS is that it has a very user friendly interface and it can also store all the user data on AWS cloud servers.<br>
            <br>
            For the web version, I would build it using HTML and CSS.<br>
            <br>
            I would also like to try setting up a server for the data instead of having to rely on an outside system to host all the data.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the current value of each item, I want the app to be able to reference recent sale prices from www.reverb.com. I would have to research this as i don't currently have the knowledge required for this feature to work.</p>


            <h4>Skills Required</h4>

            <p>There are a few different skills that are required to build my project.<br>
              <br>
            The first would be skills required to create the app. This would involve knowing how to write code in either Kotlin or Java if I chose to build it using Android Studio.
            There are many tutorials on the web for learning these skills so i dont think it would be too difficult.<br>
            <br>
            The other option would be using AWS Amplify. AWS has tutorials on how to use their system.<br>
            <br>
            There would be some hardware requirements if I chose to attempt to create a server for the data. This would involve a basic computer setup as a server. There are many cheapo second hand computers available so acquiring the hardware for this would be easy.</p>

          <h4>  Outcome</h4>

          <p>  If my project is successful then it will provide an easy, user friendly way to keep track of all of the guitars and guitar related items you own. It will keep all the information entered in one central, easy to access location. The app will also provide you with a valuation on each item based on recent sales.</p>
