          <p>My Name is Adam Puckeridge, I was born in Australia & grew up in the Sutherland Shire in NSW.<br>
             <br>
             I started playing guitar at the age of 13 and also took up drums around the age of 15. I have played drums in multiple bands in Sydney.<br>
             <br>
             I left school in year 11 to take a job teaching guitar and drums with the hope of being able to be a professional musician. After many years of pursuing that dream I realised it was something I was not 100% committed to and would struggle to make it as a professional musician if I was not committed fully.<br>
              <br>
              In 2017 I moved to the NSW Central West with my partner and our 2 dogs & soon after took on a stray as a third. Around the same time I started to learn Japanese as a second language (with English as my first) & would love to visit Japan. <br>
               <br>
              I also enjoy reading and my favourite author is Stephen King.</p>
